# Aline Roque 

Data Analyst with a solid engineering background. 
I hold a Master of Science in Civil Engineering from the University of São Paulo, specializing in Geotechnical Engineering. With over 8 years of experience in geotechnics across academic and industrial sectors, I’ve worked as an engineer, consultant, and researcher. Throughout my career, I’ve developed both technical and behavioral skills that are highly relevant to data analysis, such as attention to detail, problem-solving, and strong analytical abilities. 

# About Me

I am naturally curious, with a restless mind that drives me to explore, investigate, learn, observe, and seek answers. I have a passion for understanding things around me, constantly pushing me to acquire new knowledge and skills. My inquisitive nature keeps me motivated and adaptable, always eager to embrace new challenges and discover innovative solutions.

I enjoy using data to solve problems and gain meaningful insights, whether it's a personal challenge, like optimizing my workout routine to be as efficient as possible, or in my professional life, where I use data to provide critical insights. Recently, I've been applying data to risk management and safety decision-making in the mining industry.

I’m now pivoting to analytics after nearly a decade in engineering roles, which involved extensive data analysis. I’ve always loved math and logic (I also hold a degree in Math), and I leverage my previous experience to effectively communicate the complex insights I find in data.

My current interests include advanced analytics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing (such as A/B tests and Student's t-test), and creating comprehensive, accessible data visualizations. I also enjoy mentoring and sharing knowledge with colleagues and peers in the industry.

After spending a year transitioning into data analysis, I am now seeking opportunities where I can apply my expertise and passion to contribute to meaningful projects that make a positive impact and improve people’s lives.
